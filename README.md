# refer

Directory navigation for web.

## About

Refer provides, chiefly for web administrators, a form of directory navigation for a web site; if the administrator desires, this can be made public on the respective web site for use by anyone to navigate a directory system.

HTML elements have not been indented for pragmatic simplicity, but this can easily be changed.

## Usage

These files can be uploaded onto a web site and used as a form of directory navigation for the containing directory and all subdirectories.

More file extensions should be added for better functionality.
