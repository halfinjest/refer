# refer

Directory navigation for web.

## About

Refer provides, namely for web administrators, a form of directory navigation for a website; this can be made public on a website for use by anyone to navigate the desired directory system.

## Usage

For the purpose of simplicity, HTML elements have not been indented, but this can easily be changed to allow for syntactic consistency.

The files in this repository can be uploaded onto a website and used as a form of directory navigation for the containing directory and all subdirectories. The shift key is pressed to display a preview of any image file over which the cursor hovers.

More file extensions should be added for better compatability.
